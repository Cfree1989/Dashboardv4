# Student Submission Guide

This guide explains how to submit 3D print jobs to the lab and track them through the approval process.

## Before You Submit

### Prepare Your 3D Model

Before submitting your model for 3D printing, please ensure:

1. **Your model is properly scaled** 
   - If exporting as .STL or .OBJ, you **must** scale it down to millimeters **before** exporting
   - Check that your model fits within the printer dimensions (listed in the submission form)

2. **Your model is optimized for 3D printing**
   - Fix any non-manifold edges, holes, or other mesh issues
   - Simplify complex geometry when possible
   - Create a version specifically optimized for 3D printing if needed

3. **Your file is in a supported format**
   - Accepted formats: .stl, .obj, .3mf
   - Maximum file size: 50MB

### Important Notice

We will print exactly what you send us; if the scale is wrong or you are unsatisfied with the product, it is your responsibility. We will gladly print another model for you at an additional cost. We are only responsible for print failures due to issues under our control.

     - Prusa MK4S: 9.84" × 8.3" × 8.6" (250 × 210 × 220 mm)
     - Prusa XL: 14.17" × 14.17" × 14.17" (360 × 360 × 360 mm)
     - Raise3D Pro 2 Plus: 12" × 12" × 23.8" (305 × 305 × 605 mm)
   - **Resin Printer**:
     - Formlabs Form 3: 5.7" × 5.7" × 7.3" (145 × 145 × 175 mm)

6. Acknowledge the minimum charge policy
   - All print jobs have a minimum charge of $3.00
   - Select "Yes" to confirm you understand this policy

### Step 2: Upload Your File

1. Click the file upload area or the "Choose File" button
2. Select your 3D model file (.stl, .obj, or .3mf format)
3. Wait for the file to upload successfully
   - The system will validate the file type and size
   - You'll see immediate feedback if there are any issues

### Step 3: Submit Your Request

1. Review all your entered information for accuracy
2. Click the "Submit" button
3. If there are any validation errors:
   - The form will highlight the fields with issues
   - Address all errors and try submitting again
4. Upon successful submission:
   - You'll see a success page with your job ID
   - Keep this ID for your records

## After Submission

### Staff Review Process

After submitting your model, lab staff will:

1. Review your submission
2. Open and check your model in slicer software
3. Decide whether to approve or reject your print job
4. If approved, calculate the estimated cost based on material weight

### Receiving Approval

If your submission is approved:

1. You'll receive an approval email containing:
   - Your job details (name, file, specifications)
   - Estimated cost for your print
   - A confirmation link you must click to finalize your print job

2. To confirm your print job:
   - Click the confirmation link in the email
   - This link is valid for 72 hours
   - After confirmation, your job moves to the print queue

3. If your confirmation link expires:
   - You'll see an expired link page when clicking it
   - Use the "Request New Confirmation Email" button
   - A new link will be sent to your email address

### If Your Submission Is Rejected

If your submission is rejected:

1. You'll receive a rejection email explaining the reasons
2. Common rejection reasons include:
   - Model has errors or broken geometry
   - Model is too large for available printers
   - Model has unsupported geometry
   - Model needs scaling adjustments

3. To resubmit:
   - Fix the issues mentioned in the rejection email
   - Submit a new job through the submission form
   - Reference your previous job ID if relevant

## Job Completion and Pickup

When your print is complete:

1. You'll receive a completion email notification
2. Visit the lab during open hours to pick up your print
3. Payment is due at pickup (cash or authorized payment methods)
4. Standard pricing:
   - Filament: $0.10 per gram
   - Resin: $0.20 per gram
   - $3.00 minimum charge for all prints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Confirmation Link Expired**: Request a new confirmation link through the expired link page
- **Didn't Receive Email**: Check your spam folder or contact lab staff
- **Need to Change Specifications**: Submit a new job with the correct specifications
- **Questions About Rejection**: Contact lab staff for clarification on rejection reasons
