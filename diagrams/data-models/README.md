# Data Models

This directory contains diagrams that define the structure and relationships of data within the Dashboard v4 application. These models are primarily represented using Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) written in PlantUML.

## Purpose

- **Clarify Data Structure**: Provide a clear visual representation of database schemas, entities, and their attributes.
- **Define Relationships**: Show how different data entities are connected (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many).
- **Single Source of Truth**: Serve as the canonical reference for the application's data architecture.

## Tooling

To view or edit these `.puml` files, you can use:
- **Visual Studio Code** with the [PlantUML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml).
- **Online editors** like the official [PlantUML Web Server](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml).
