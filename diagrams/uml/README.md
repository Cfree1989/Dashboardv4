# UML Diagrams

This directory contains Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams that describe the system's architecture, behavior, and interactions. These diagrams are written in PlantUML, a text-based diagramming language.

## Types of Diagrams

- **Sequence Diagrams**: Show how objects interact in a particular scenario over time.
- **Class Diagrams**: Describe the structure of the system by showing its classes, attributes, operations, and relationships.
- **Use Case Diagrams**: Represent the interactions between actors (users) and the system.
- **Component Diagrams**: Illustrate how components are wired together to form larger components or software systems.
